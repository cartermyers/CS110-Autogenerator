# Autogenerated Questions for CS110
---------------------------------------------------

This is a collection of random, autogenerated multiple choice questions for the use of CS110 quizzes.
By inputting the options outlined in control.txt and running Source.cpp, a .txt file is created containing the specified questions in GIFT format.


###### Here is each category of questions with examples of each difficulty (or subcategory) listed by Roman numerals. The correct answers are in bold.

## Arrays
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### (i) - Element Swap
What are the contents of the array after the following statements?
```cpp
int bar[6] = {6, 5, 3, 8, 1, 9};
int temp;
temp = bar[4];
bar[4] = bar[1];
bar[1] = temp;
```

- **```{6, 1, 3, 8, 5, 9}```**
- ```{6, 5, 3, 8, 1, 9}```
- ```{8, 5, 3, 8, 1, 3}```
- ```{8, 5, 3, 6, 1, 9}```
- ```{6, 5, 9, 8, 1, 3}```


##### (ii) - Element access
What are the contents of a given array after all elements are incremented by 1, 5, or 10.
```cpp
int foo[5] = {4, 0, 7, 1, 5};
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i += 1)
{
	foo[i] += 10;
}
```
- **```{14, 10, 17, 11, 15}```**
- ```{15, 11, 18, 12, 1}```
- ```{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}```
- ```{-6, -10, -3, -9, -5}```
- ```{4, 0, 7, 1, 5}```


## Loops
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All Loops have the same nature of questions, they are just in different formats based on
selection (For Loop, While Loop, or Do While Loop).

There is also an option to change the type of questions inside Loops.cpp (see Loops::TypeOne()
and Loops::TypeTwo() for more details)

Here are all of the currently used Loop questions.

#### Loop Counting

##### (i) - Single Loops using additive and subtractive updates

How many times does the '\*' print?
```cpp
for (int a = 31; a > 22; a = a - 5)
{
	cout << '*' << " ";
}
```

- **2**
- 1
- 3
- 8
- 6

##### (ii) - Single Loops using multiplicative and divisive (?) updates

How many times does the '\*' print?
```cpp
int d = 61;
while (d > 4)
{
	cout << '*' << " ";
	d /= 2;
}	
```
- **4**
- 3
- 5
- 8
- 2


##### (iii) - A similar question to (i) but with nested loops

How many times does the '\*' print?
```cpp
int i = 17;
do
{
	int j = 73;
	do
	{		
		cout << '*' << " ";
		j = j + 10;
	} while (j <= 106);
	i = i - 1;
} while (i > 14);
```

- **12**
- 4
- 3
- 13
- 16

##### (iv) - A similar question to (ii) but with nested loops

How many times does the '\*' print?
```cpp
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i = i * 2)
{
	for (int j = 451; j >= 1; j = j / 10)
	{
		cout << '*' << " ";
	}
}
```
- **9**
- 4
- 3
- 12
- 16

#### Loop Printing

This is currently only used for single loops in (i) and (ii). I think this would be too difficult with nested loops.

##### (i) - Single Loops that output the "loop variable" at every iteration

What is the following output of the code?
```cpp
int b = 85;
while (b > 40)
{
	cout << b << " ";
	b -= 10;
}	
```
- **85 75 65 55 45**
- 75 65 55 45 
- 75 65 55 45 35 
- 85 75 65 55 
- 85 75 65 55 45 35 

##### (ii) Similar to (i) but with multiplicative and divisive increments

What is the following output of the code?
```cpp
int j = 1915;
do
{
	cout << j << " ";
	j = j / 10;
} while (j >= 2);
```

- **1915 191 19** 
- 191 19 
- 191 19 1 
- 1915 191 
- 1915 191 19 1 

## Expressions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### (i) - (iv) Integer Expressions
 All subcategories are the same, but with different number of operands.

Solve the following problem:
```cpp
int foo = 2;
int bar = foo * 4 % 2 + 4;
```
What is the variable "bar" equal to?

- **4**
- 5
- 5.5
- 6
- 8

## Functions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### (i) - Reference Parameters
###### The order of the parameters and the arguments have the option of being randomized.

What values are printed out at the end of the code?
```cpp
void Find(int b, int& c, int& a)
{
	c = b / c * a;
}
int main()
{
   int dogs = 6;
   int matrix = 8;
   int marks = 3;
   Find(dogs, matrix, marks);
   cout << matrix << endl;
   return 0;
}
```
- **0**
- 8
- 2.25
- 3
- 0.25

##### (ii) - Parameter and Return types
###### The return type has an option of being "void", so the answer is sometimes a compile-time error

What values are printed out at the end of the code?
```cpp
float Switch(float item, int dogs)
{
    return item + dogs;
}
int main()
{
    cout << Switch(5.5, 0.5);
    return 0;
}
```
- **5.5**
- Compile-time error
- Run-time error
- 6
- 4.5


## Switch Cases
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### (i) - A switch case statement with random breaks and possibly a default case.

What is the value of bar after the switch/case block?
```cpp
int bar = 4;
switch (bar) {
	case 2:
		bar = 5;
		break;
	case 4:
		bar = 6;
		break;
	case 1:
		bar = 4;
	case 3:
		bar = 0;
	case 0:
		bar = 1;
		break;
}
```
- **6**
- 8
- 5
- 4
- 1

##### (ii) - A "normal" switch case statement with all breaks and always a default case.

What is the value of list after the switch/case block?
```cpp
int list = 4;
switch (list) {
	case 3:
		list = 3;
		break;
	case 0:
		list = 2;
		break;
	case 2:
		list = 0;
		break;
	default:
		list = 1;
}
```
- **1**
- 0
- 2
- 4
- 3


##### (iii) - A switch case statement with no breaks, but with a default.

What is the value of item after the switch/case block?
```cpp
int item = 3;
switch (item) {
	case 2:
		item = 4;
	case 3:
		item = 0;
	case 4:
		item = 3;
	case 5:
		item = 1;
	default:
		item = 6;
}
```
- **6**
- 0
- 2
- 3
- 8

##### (iv) - A switch case statement with no breaks and no default.

What is the value of item after the switch/case block?
```cpp
int item = 3;
switch (item) {
	case 6:
		item = 1;
	case 0:
		item = 0;
	case 5:
		item = 2;
	case 4:
		item = 4;
	case 2:
		item = 5;
}
```
- **3**
- 1
- 6
- 4

## Conditionals
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```cpp
int numbers = 3;
int marks = 8;
(numbers >= 4) == (marks >= 10)

- **True**
- False

##### (ii) The same question as (i) but with 3 different logical subexpressions

```
- **False**
- True
