notes on - what 110 is
- why we chose moodle
- why we chose GIFT (easy for students to write their questions, not syntax heavy)
- reference to Moodle article on GIFT? footnote for a webpage

- intro section to describe distractors, why they need to be convincing, some examples
- whole section on distractors?
- also a small intro on trivial cases (also has room for improvement)

packages:
- listings package?
- fancy vrb
- verbatim

- differentiate between GIFT code and C++ code
- three types of code:
    1) The main program
    2) The GIFT code it generates
    3) The code the students are learning
