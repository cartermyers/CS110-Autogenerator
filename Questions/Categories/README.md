This is the directory for the main program and main class. All classes in here should be called directly by the main program, and their sole function is to implement the four type functions (TypeOne(), etc.) by *printing* each of their questions. They should all inherent the Question class, and they should start with a "Q" followed by their category name (e.g. "QArrays"). Any (if not most) of the real implementation like generating the values, the answers, the whole structure of the question, should be implemented in the other folder titled "Generators".
